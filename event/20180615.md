### Datasource, example of tick data

Contain pricing, volume and count for each side(big and ask)
Some issues with ticks


### Pitfalls with financial data

Mostly noise, low signal to noise ratio
Shifting trends.
Live and backtesting feed inconsistencies.
Calendar peculiarities -> rare events needs to be handled.

### Machine learning models

- linear regressions, SVM...
Then used RNN
-> Make intuitive sense for time series.

Then CNN
-> Fast to train.
-> Benefit from lots of research in computer vision.
-> Reach great performances.

### Model package

All prediction models are managed in a package format called ModelPackage:
-> model topology
-> learned models
-> training parameters
-> dataset configurations: Features and labels
-> Input data format

### Model development: feedback from the trenches

To avoid them, you can try:
-> Online inference
-> Leaking on purpose
Integrate those steps in your CI!

### Evaluating models

Report performance for subsets of data:
    -> Split your test periods and assess stability.
    -> Filter by hour/day of week.

### TimeSeries optimized database: MarketStore

### Production environment

Data can be buffered in the SQS.
queue in case the marketstore is dead.

- API(Bloomberg App)


### Production environment: feedback from the trenches


-> Unordered tick data
-> Memory consumption of models explode

### MarketStore

MarketStore is a database server optimized for financial timeseries data.

### Proposed Architecture

Cropped image -> CNN(+feat.) -> MLP -> Traget object
embedding -> LSTM -> MLP -> Target object
embedding -> LSTM -> MLP -> destination box

### Handling Ambiguity

-> Trained with a hinge loss for positive/negative object-sentence pairs

FANUC M10iA robot arm

### Interactive Picking Dataset

100 types of commodities
